I am Michael Loh and I currently work as a Staff Software Engineer at Visa.

I also have an interest in Home Automation so I don't kill more plants / fold any more clothes, though I am too lazy. One fine day...

In my free time I also (try) to work on small projects to learn new technologies

I published a few papers during my time at <a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/bii" target="_blank">A-Star</a>. View them [here](/publications/).

Looking for my resume, grap the pdf [here](/resume/resume.pdf), alternatively view the online version [here](/resume/).
