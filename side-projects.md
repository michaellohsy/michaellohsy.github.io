- [Weather app](/nea_weather/) using National Environment Agency (NEA)'s [weather api](https://www.nea.gov.sg/api){:target="\_blank"}. Created with AngularJS. The git repository can be found [here](https://github.com/michaellohsy/nea_weather).
- [Evolving Generalized Voronoi Diagram](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cyto.a.20876){:target="_blank"} (EGVD) is a cell segmentation algorithm capable of segmenting touching cells. It requires 2 images to work: a cell image containing the cells and a seed image containing the cell nuclei. I created an EGVD plugin for [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/){:target="\_blank"} (a popular image processing software) to allow users to use this algorithm in ImageJ as well. You can download the jar file [here](/downloads/EGVD_.jar). Put the jar file in ImageJ's plugin directory and you are good to go. Enjoy.
